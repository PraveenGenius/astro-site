Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

This project is not about trading its about decentralization and w3.

In collabration with few w3 projects I'm building smart contracts and dapps, will post here soon after integrating my ENS domains with this personal site
